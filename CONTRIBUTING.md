# How to contribute to Pext

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Pext. Contributions are very appreciated. This document should help you figure out how to contribute most efficiently. Don't worry about getting things wrong, they can always manually be moved to the right place :)

## I found a bug / I have a feature request
1. Make sure your modules, themes and Pext are up-to-date. The bug or feature may have already been fixed or added!
2. Try to determine where the report fits best. Does it relate directly to a module or theme? Look for it in [our GitHub organisation](https://github.com/Pext/). Are you unsure? Simply go to [Pext's repository](https://github.com/Pext/Pext), it can always be moved to the right place.
3. Click "Issues" to see a list of issues and do a quick search. If someone already reported it, it is better to add the information to the existing issue. Otherwise, click "New issue" in the top right.
4. When reporting, try to add as much relevant information you can think of, such as your Operating System and the Pext version you are running. Don't worry if you don't know much. More information helps find the issue more quickly, but is not always necessary.

Thank you for your bug report or feature request!

Alternatively, if you're a developer, submitting a Pull Request is of course very welcome. If your changes will be substantial, you may want to consider creating an issue first to discuss it, so you won't waste too much time on something that may not be approved. This is not a requirement however. Submitting a Pull Request to fix an issue someone else reported is also very, very welcome.

## I have a question
For questions, there are several ways you can go. You can either ask on IRC ([#pext on OFTC](https://webchat.oftc.net/?randomnick=1&channels=pext&prompt=1)) or report an issue as written in the bug reporting guide. Both are valid, use whatever method you prefer.

## I want to help translate
For any way of translating, including improving existing translations, please [check out our Weblate page](https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/pext/?utm_source=widget). You can also create a pull request, but Weblate is much preferred as it saves a lot of work for everyone involved.

## I created a module or theme that I want included in the online module or theme list
The online module list is managed on [the pext.github.io repository](https://github.com/Pext/pext.github.io). If your module or theme is available under a Free/Open license, please create a new issue there describing your module and giving a git link to it. The Pext team reserves the right to decide if a module will be included or not, and reserves the right to remove the link at any time.

## My question is missing from this document
Please create a new issue on [Pext's issue tracker](https://github.com/Pext/Pext/issues) describing what information you'd like to see in this document.
