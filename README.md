## Introduction

Pext stands for **P**ython-based **ex**tendable **t**ool. It is built using Python 3 and Qt5 QML and has its behaviour decided by modules. Pext provides a simple window with a search bar, allowing modules to define what data is shown and how it is manipulated.

For example, say you want to use Pext as a password manager. You load in the pass module, and it will show you a list of your passwords which you can filter with the search bar. When you select a password in the list, it will copy the password to your clipboard and Pext will hide itself, waiting for you to ask for it again.

Depending on the module you choose, what entries are shown and what happens when you select an entry changes. So choose the module appropriate for what you want to do, and Pext makes it easy.

Several modules are available for effortless install right within Pext.

## How it works

Pext is designed to quickly pop up and get out of your way as soon as you're done with something. It is recommended to bind Pext to some global hotkey, or possibly run multiple instances of it with different profiles under multiple hotkeys. Example Pext workflows look as follows:

![Pext workflow graph](/assets/workflow_graph.png)

Simply put:

- Open (Pext)
- Search (for something)
- Select (with Enter)
- Hide (automatically)

## Installation

Check the install instructions at [Read the Docs](https://pext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html).

## Usage

To actually use Pext, you will first have to install one or more modules. Check out the Pext organisation on [GitHub](https://github.com/Pext) or use `Module` -> `Install module` -> `From online module list` in the application for a list of modules.

After installating at least one module, you can load it from the `Module` -> `Load module` menu. After that, experiment! Each module is different.

For command line options, use `--help`.
