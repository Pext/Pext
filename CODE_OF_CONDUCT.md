# Pext Code of Conduct

## Purpose

A primary goal of Pext is to be inclusive to the largest number of participants,
with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. As such, we are committed
to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of
gender, sexual and romantic orientation, ability, ethnicity, socio-economic
status, or religion (or lack thereof).

This Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in
our community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behaviour.

We invite all those who participate in Pext to help us create safe and positive
experiences for everyone.

## Open culture citizenship

A supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase open culture
citizenship by encouraging participants to recognize and strengthen the
relationships between our actions and their effects on our community.
Communities mirror the societies in which they exist, and positive action is
essential to counteract the many forms of inequality and abuses of power that
exist in societies everywhere.

As such, Pext is committed to the goal of open culture. Specifically, our
community ensures that:

* All source code is available under an open-source license.
* All documentation, including artwork and logos, are available under an open
  culture license.
* Copyleft licenses are employed throughout to guarantee independence from
  corporate influence and to preserve the benefits of any modifications for all.
* Everything created by our community is available in an accessible way, without
  DRM or other artificial restrictions to use and participation.

We require all participants in our community to consider and abide by the
principles above, in the spirit in which they are included in this Code of
Conduct.

## Expected behaviour

The following behaviours are expected and requested of all community members:

* Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you contribute to the
  health and longevity of this community.
* Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.
* Attempt collaboration before conflict.
* Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory and harassing behaviour and speech.
* Be mindful of your surroundings and your fellow participants. Alert community
  leaders if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or
  violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.
* Remember that community venues, both physical and digital, may be shared with
  members of the public. Please be respectful to all patrons of such locations.

## Unacceptable behaviour

The following behaviours are considered harassment and are unacceptable within
our community:

* Violence, threats of violence or violent language directed against another
  person. Note that misgendering, especially intentional misgendering, is a
  form of violent language and will not be tolerated.
* Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist or otherwise discriminatory
  jokes and language.
* Posting or displaying sexually explicit or violent material.
* Posting or threatening to post other people's personally identifying
  information ("doxing").
* Personal insults, particularly those related to gender, sexual or romantic
  orientation, ethnicity, religion or disability.
* Inappropriate photography or recording. Note that photography or recording
  without prior consent is _always_ inappropriate.
* Inappropriate physical contact. You must have someone's consent before
  touching them.
* Unwelcome sexual attention. This includes, but is not limited to: sexualized
  comments or jokes, inappropriate touching, groping and unwelcome sexual
  advances. If you do not have someone's prior consent, then any kind of sexual
  attention is unwelcome.
* Deliberate intimidation or stalking (online or in person).
* Advocating for, encouraging, or assisting in any of the above behaviour.
* Sustained disruption of community spaces or events.

## Consequences of unacceptable behaviour

Unacceptable behaviour from any community member, including anyone with
decision-making authority, will not be tolerated. Anyone asked to stop
unacceptable behaviour is expected to comply immediately.

If a community member engages in unacceptable behaviour, the community
organizers may take any action they deem appropriate. These include, but are not
limited to:

* A verbal warning (either in private or in public).
* A temporary ban of any length with right of appeal.
* A temporary ban of any length without right of appeal, by unanimous consent of
  the community organizers.
* A permanent ban with right of appeal.
* A permanent ban without right of appeal, by unanimous consent of the community
  organizers.
* Temporary revocation of community organizer status for any length of time, with 
  right of appeal.
* Temporary revocation of community organizer status for any length of time,
  without right of appeal, by unanimous consent of the remaining community
  organizers.
* Permanent revocation of community organizer status with right of appeal.
* Permanent revocation of community organizer status without right of appeal, by
  unanimous consent of the remaining community organizers.
* Removal of contributions to Pext from any Pext-associated repositories, with
  right of appeal.
* Removal of contributions to Pext from any Pext-associated repositories,
  without right of appeal, by unanimous consent
* Notification of law enforcement, or other appropriate authorities, along with
  any evidence of wrongdoing provided to the community organizers.

## Weapons policy

No weapons are allowed at Pext community events, community spaces, or in other
spaces covered by the scope of this Code of Conduct. Weapons include, but are
not limited to, guns, explosives (including fireworks without prior approval by
a community organizer), and large knives such as those used for hunting or
display, as well as any other item used for the purpose of causing injury and
harm to others. Anyone seen in the possession of these items will be asked to
leave immediately, and will only be allowed to return without the weapon.
Community members are further required to comply with all local laws and
regulations on this matter.

Repeated violations of this policy are grounds for enforcement actions as if
against unacceptable behaviour.

## Reporting guidelines

If you are subject to, or witness, unacceptable behaviour, or have any other
concerns, please notify a community organizer as soon as possible. The current
list of community organizers is:

* Sylvia van Os <sylvia@hackerchick.me> (lead organizer)
* Koz Ross <koz.ross@retro-freedom.nz>

When reporting, please include the following information, to the best of your
knowledge and ability:

* When and where the unacceptable behaviour occurred.
* Who engages in unacceptable behaviour.
* Which unacceptable behaviour(s) happened.
* Any evidence for your report (such as screencaps, logs, etc)
* Who (besides yourself) was affected by this behaviour.
* Whether you want any additional actions taken by the community organizers to 
  ensure that your safety and well-being remain intact.

Additionally, community organizers can assist local authorities and connect you
with help or providing a safe environment. In the context of in-person events, 
organizers will also provide escorts as desired by the person experiencing distress.

## Addressing grievances

If you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of
Conduct, you should notify the community organizers with a concise
description of your grievance. You should include the following information:

* What report of unacceptable behaviour you are responding to.
* Why you believe specifically that you did not engage in this behaviour, or
  why you believe the enforcement actions taken against you are
  disproportionate.
* Any evidence you can provide for your grievance.
* What actions you wish to be taken to address your grievance if found genuine.

If you have been temporarily, or permanently, banned without right of appeal,
any grievances filed with community organizers regarding the incident which
caused the ban will be ignored.

## Scope

We expect all community participants (contributors, paid or otherwise; sponsors;
and other guests) to abide by this Code of Conduct in all 
community venues, as well as in one-to-one communications pertaining to community 
business. This Code of Conduct also applies to unacceptable behaviour occuring 
outside the scope of community activities when such behaviour has the 
potential to adversely affect the safety and well-being of community members.

## Contact information

This is the current list of community organizers, with appropriate contact
information:

* Sylvia van Os <sylvia@hackerchick.me> (lead organizer)
* Koz Ross <koz.ross@retro-freedom.nz>

## Modifications

The community organizers reserve the right to modify this Code of Conduct to 
take into account future situations that could not have been foreseen
at the time of its writing, or to address lack of clarity or inconsistencies
that become apparent with practice. Additionally, we must update this document
with any changes in the community organizer team when appropriate.

We will notify the community when any changes are made, along with a description
of the content of these changes. These, along with previous versions, will be
available in a publically accessible repository for the purpose of comparison.
The most current version of this Code of Conduct is considered to be
canonical with regard to content and policy.
